I ' m not sure why this happen , but apparently it be not that uncommon for we . my arm and hand be still bruise and it be be almost 2 week since my expander exhange surgery . the anestesiologist stick I 4 time before he get a vein that would not collapse to start the iv for surgery . so do not feel alone ! I know how you feel ... and it be frustate and painful . hopefully most of this be behind you now !",True

298,0,True,"As I understand it , the breast will drain into one primary sentinel node . Sometimes it becomes 2 nodes if they are nearby each other and the drainage is shared .

However , if a mx is prophylactic , then no cancer is assumed . The risk for lymphedema is not a solid number at this time , as there are many variables , the primary one being how many lymph nodes were taken out . That said , there are those who have developed LE with no sentinel node disturbance - the mx surgery itself was enough .

637,0,False,"Hi Darlings Thank you so much for your messages , they mean so much coming as they do from the perspective of those a bit `` down the line '' from my position . So we share empathy that 's not patronising or misguide , or embarrsed . I feel strangely ok now . I was told by my the Oncies nurses that I might get 2 more courses of Tax -LRB- they KNOW their stuff -RRB- so I was expecting it , then the results of the histology of he tumour was soooo good . I think I was expecting the ax to fall and that was why I was so weepy after my good news . Thinking `` it ca n't be THAT easy , Netts , not with your luck ! '' I had the Consultant , Mr Yusef laughing . He is Egyptian , quite old and a genius -LRB- he was honoured by the Queen -RRB- , but is quite shy and unsmiling . Well before he introduced me to his young colleague who will he taking over my case I asked to be introduced to his grandson . He laughed out loud , which Angela the BC nurse who was in with me , said she had n't seen often , and rarely in a consultation . I just asked for the lads skin care routine cos he looked like he should be in primary school . It just seems 4 courses when I do n't have cancer in me seems a lot , especially getting Herceprin the day before . Of our group here in Scotland , there only 3 of us who are HER2 + , so no one here has had this kind of tharapy ! Can any one out there help ? They might stop at 2 courses , depending on how I tolerate it , so I have to keep a close diary of s/e , as some of them might become permanent.I think that 's why Martin , my bestest oncy , told me to prepare myself for 2 sessions of `` the yew tree poison '' . That kind of freaked me out !! What s/e might become permanent ??? They reckon the cancer was only about a year old and grew so fast and was n't ` hard ' , except round the edges , so difficult to detect by touch . Anyway , I think they recommend 4 courses as an ideal and I will try to take all 4 . I do n't understand why the Herceptrin is concurrent as the protocol is for 18 courses 3 weeks apart after chemo and rads . So I think I will have to have another 18 after rads as that seems to be the norm . Anyway , I literally trust Mr Yusef with my life . Literally !! Feel more positive now there is another challenge . At least now , I can not be turned down for DLA , -LRB- surely !! -RRB- which will be a huge weight of the finances . Some other bits of good news . My new Irish jig is lovely , really natural and exactly like a designer cut I had years ago , for which I paid a fortune -LRB- I uses to work for an oil company in the Shetland Isles -RRB- so spending was no biggie ... back then ! Anyway , I am really pleased with it , though I love having a cool shower , putting on a lovely cotton nightie -LRB- I have bought some really nice ones , can easily wear them to answer the door -RRB- and putting on a terry towelling head wrap to chill out after a sticky day . Adrinna , the fitter , shaved off the ` bum fluff ' hair on Monday and I have had real hair growing back already -LRB- I look like a Naxi -RRB- ! I will lose it again , of course , but hay ho . the worst of all these things has already happened ! OH lots of silver there where there was n't before , proof that chemo DOES age you !!! Going to lose my lashes again - boo hoo , they were just looking nice , and my nails . They 're horrible just now , but have n't fallen off ! AND my beautiful Dell pink rubberised laptop is fixed . Hurrah !!! And it only cost # 10 , not the # 316 I was quoted elsewhere !! I love that machine more that an inanimate thing has the right to be loved !!! It just needed cleaning of the bloody lemonade and the motherboard tightened . I promise I will never let anyone hurt it again . They will have to wear gloves it they touch it , under close supervision ! My wonderful brother Hugh had it repaired for me . I was going down to Blackpool today for a break before I am back on the treadmill , but was pretty sick yesterday , so will go tomorrow . Need to get all my dental work done before 31st when it all starts again , we were going to stagger it over 3 visits . Wow ! chemo really damages the teeth , minor damage certainly , but I need a veneer as my root canal work has discoloured . I paid # 190 last year to have it internally whitened , which worked too . So that 's the news from the front gals . Feeling quite positive . Always do for challenges and I know this is the best chance of beating this bugger stone dead and THAT 'S motivational . I am a stubborn bugger . AE , how is UB , responding to treatment ? Thank god they got it early . Reassure us ! Sue , Aloe Vera is wonderful for any kind of burn . I have a huge Aloe Vera plant and also a 500ml tube living in my fridge constantly . It 's dead cheap and pure 99.9 % pure - only # 4.99 from Holland and Barrett . Makes a lovely skin moisturiser too , Great as an after sun . But if your burn does n't respond , you have got to go to A & E if it is on your ` at risk ' arm . I was given 2 big leaflets from the hosp when I had surgery . 1 in 3 of us who had lymph removal will get lympheodema and injuries to the at risk arm are not to be dismissed.They might be serious . Please seek help !!! Mel , what a horrible time you have had . What a spiteful , vindictive thing for that arse to do . OK , maybe he got tired storing your stuff , but he could have been decent , explained that to you and given you notice to make other arrangments !!! -LRB- Sorry ! I sneaked ` arse ' through customs ! -RRB- Where are you staying now ? It must be scary not having a roof over your head , tho ' it sounds like you have good support , if not space for stuff . Money worries suck too . I am not a breadhead , never worshipped money , but when there is more going out than coming in ... . stress on a new level.Your outlook , though , is inspirational . You sound like you have the most wonderful son . Lucky old you . Family can see you through ANY troubles . There is n't a day that I take my family for granted for what they have done to support me through all this . Judie !!!!!! Dinnae ! I gasped at your comment too.Had to re-read it twice . Funny , I developed a wee purple frekle -LRB- sp -RRB- on my boob , right over the tumour . Doc said it was nothing to worry about ! Maybe is was n't . Pretty colour it is . Cathi , my next door neighbour and her partner were separated , but amicable enough . One Sunday afternoon he called round to see the kids with his mum and sister , he was really pleasant to me as I was leaving the house to pick up the Sundays , and by the time I got back , 2 cars were screeching away from the house , I was just across the road so did n't see anything but heard raised voices . It took about 15 minutes as the shop is just down the road . Later that evening 2 policemen came to my door to see if I saw or heard anything . I tried to be helpful but did n't see anything at all , and only saw Peter knocking the door , and saw the cars driving away at speed . He had done to Joanne what your SIN did to Jacklyn . Jo was out of the house for 2 weeks and I was worried sick . The house was just empty . She came home after 2 weeks a wreck , terrified of her own shadow . She looked ok by then -LRB- she used Arnica gel on the bruising -RRB- , but they had taken pics and OMG she was black and blue . She too , had thumb marks on her neck , split lip etc and she got the police at once . She had met someone else -LRB- who now living with her and they are very happy -RRB- The red mist just decended on Peter , her ex . Ironic , as had lots of affairs and he left Jo ! -RRB- The case went to trial . I was initially called , but because I could contribute anything , was let off testifying . He was found ` not proven ' - a weird Scottish verdict that means they knew he was guilty but could n't prove it as there were no witnesses -LRB- rational was that it could have been the mum or the sister - they just knew she had been assaulted , and they claimed it was just a fight , not an assault -RRB- I always felt that if I just said I heard her screaming or saw something ... that might have made the difference.The kids heard it all , but the court would not accept their testimony as Jo might have `` groomed '' them . I have always felt a bit guilty for not backing her up be saying I saw something . But that would have been perjury . Anyway the upshot is the he can only see the kids under supervision and they do n't want anything to do with him -LRB- and HE was a devoted dad , especially to Louis -RRB- . Jo is with a lovely guy now who is great to the kids -LRB- and to me - they ca n't do enough for me since my dx -RRB- So there is hope for the future . Just make sure that he fulfils his financial responsibility to them . Your pic was great , we just do n't / ca n't get enough photos of Margot and the kids . How is Jacklyn doing ? Poor lass , she has n't had to seek her troubles , has she ? She has got a great mum though , and I 'll bet the house she knows it ! Has your other daughter and her Horrible Hubby decended on you yet ? Lay down the rules ! It 's much better if people know their boundries , including putting money in the pot ! Long term guests are not cheap !! Ivorymom , Lynda , Jane and all of you . Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support . All of my family and friends thank you for your support as you guys fulfil a role THAT NOBOBY ELSE can !!

495,2,False,"Liz , My husband loves my foobs because he loves me . Yes , they deform when I flex , which certainly happens during sex , but mostly we 've been in the dark or dim light , so I 've felt a little better about it , as they were n't as visible . I think regular silicone that is placed sub-pectorally will also deform during flexing too , because it is under the muscle , not necessarily because it 's a gummy . I wonder if someone who has had both can chime in on that ? I still occasionally wear a top too during sex . He would n't care if we were under fluorescent lights and he could see every ripple , dent , or oddity . He knows I 'm self conscious about them so does n't push me to disrobe when I do n't want to . I think he picks up on my vibe of `` this area is a no fly zone '' , and has respected that . I do n't have sensation back , and that does bother me , but I 'm told that may return in time . If it does n't , he 'll just continue to search for more `` responsive '' zones . I 've read every one of your posts from your first one over a year ago , because I too have really had a problem with the dents , bumps , bubbles , ridges , etc , of these door stops that now reside on my chest masquerading as boobs . I felt better reading your posts when you said that they loosed up and you were ok with the firmness now . I am also going to try fat grafting at some point in the near future . My PS wants me to wait because of the extra surgeries I needed for the infection I got . I feel for you going through this single , but please know that most guys will be too distracted with the fact that they are in bed with a beautiful , sexy and totally fabulous woman to notice what you see as glaringly obvious . Every time I call my husband in to the bathroom to look at a new `` deformity , '' that I 'd discovered , he actually has to really search for what I 'm seeing . Your new boyfriend will likely do that too . He will know about what you 've been through before you get to the point where you are in bed together , and will be sensitive to your feelings . My husband is just so happy that I 'm alive and doing well that I think he would n't care what I looked like . During that 5 week period after my infection when I only had one expander , he still wanted to be with me . To me I never looked worse , and thought my right side looked like an old lady without her teeth in . He did n't care . I , on the other hand , have n't been really that interested in sex for awhile since all this happened . BC can rip away at ones sexuality like nothing else . My husband looks at reconstructed , and un-reconstructed boobs for a living , and that may dull the impact of mine a little bit , but I think that regardless of the fact that he deals with cancer every day , he would still love my foobs for what they are , because of who they are attached to , not what they look like when flexing in a certain position . I will reiterate what many others have posted here , if he has a problem with the way you look or feel , then he is n't the man for you . There are so many men out there that will not just accept them , but LOVE them ! One thing I learned in my dating years ... Men do n't care how they look necessarily . It does n't matter what size , shape , or texture , if they are lucky enough to get some one on one time with them , they are happy as can be ! Now a question for you ...

135,6,True,I am in the same boat and have the bottle of Tamox sitting there waiting for me to try it . I am also trying to understand why I am taking it and might call my onc again .

218,5,False,"Well , yesterday morning I woke up so nauseated I thought I was going to hurl before we even left the house . I did n't sleep AT ALL that night and looked like total HELL !!! We took the train in had lunch at the Brigham and Women 's cafeteria -LRB- much better than Dana Farber 's FYI if you ever need to know -RRB- because it took me two hours to even think of eating ANYTHING . We get to Dana , and I sign in and find out that my onc is running an hour late , so I go in to panic mode and say I am supposed to start at 2:30 what do we do ? Do we go without talking to her panic panic panic !!! So the very nice lady , obviously used to crazy people told us to go to the waiting room for my vitals . On the way in this tech stopped me and told me my fly was open . So I 'm called in for my vitals , and it 's the same lab tech ! And I just love her !! I go in and she asked the dreaded `` are you having any pain ? '' question , and I told her that actually all the cancer was gone in the operation and this was all preventative chemo . I also told her my blood pressure was going to be sky high and we took bets on it , and I won . She was awesome . She had me laughing before I was out of there and I wish I could get her every time . Then I go in for the IV . I get the thing put in and then the tech says you are getting bla bla and HERCEPTIN and I am like NO I 'M NOT !!! -LRB- Blood pressure back to 140/100 pulse through the roof -RRB- So she says well that 's ok just check with the doc before you go up . So we have about a 45 minute wait where I see another woman who is starting today , someone with a hand full of films and another woman who reminded me of me who was clearly at the beginning of her nightmare and num because she was jabbering in this overly happy , numb way that I did at the beginning . I really felt for her especially because she had this gorgeous thick blond hair that went down to the middle of her back and I knew she would be having an even tougher time than I was with this . It was too bad too because she was alone . My heart went out to her . Anyway , we finally get in and my doctor 's nurse practitioner is there and she asks me how I am doing and I start going a mile a minute about how scared I am about everything and I freak out about the whole Herceptin thing . That was straightened out . I guess because they had to reserve the longest infusion time and the actual order went up with me . And I was give all the facts and in the middle my oncologist came in and it was all good and I went up to the infusion room . Each chair had its own area that could be closed off if you wanted to , my nurse was awesome ! I am on four rounds of Cytoxin and Andriamycin followed by four rounds of Taxol . I wish that the doc would say this is the cure . But they wo n't and I understand but I want to hear that word so bad it hurts . But 85 % chance of never dealing with this again is nothing to complain about ! So while I sit through the infusion , my darling husband runs around to fill the nausea med prescription and make the appointment in Plastic Surgery and for the wig styling for me and I feel totally fine . We took the subway back to the train station and realize that the train riding days are over . My husband says he does n't want me to catch the `` SARS-Bird-Flu-Malaria '' on the train ! I love how he can make me laugh no matter what ! I woke up at 4:00 am with my stomach feeling queasy . I do n't know if it was because of the chemo or nerves . But I took the meds at 8:00 am anyway . I am popping in to work only long enough to get some work to do at home . My shots came to the house yesterday and hubby was shown how to give them to me so that is all set . I have decided not to get my hair cut today . I will do it next week . Actually I am feeling better about the whole thing this morning for some reason . Maybe because there were so many people in one place yesterday talking about it to me and taking it in stride . This one lady heard me talking about how horrified I was with the nurse and she came right over to talk . I guess I am still amazed at the kindness of people , and how they have been reaching out to me . Maybe its because I am a child abuse survivor . I know that this whole experience has brought a lot of issues I thought were dead and buried back that has n't been fun . But I have to say to all of you who I absolutely value more than I ever expected , I am in a much more peaceful place this morning . I did not wake up afraid for the first time in many months and that is a huge surprise especially because I think of how terrified I was yesterday . I know this will not all be smooth sailing but I feel like most of the `` unknown '' is out of the picture now and that makes it a lot easier to deal with .
